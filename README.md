# Multi-Vitamin Main Server

Multi-Vitamin is a challenge for high school students to solve problems from different fields. This project aims to provide a platform for the challenge.

Students can request a problem, and the program will print the problem in PDF format, with the students' group name and other relevant information added to the file. After solving the problem, students can submit their answers and receive a new problem.

Meanwhile, some people check the answers and give the students their scores. The server has an API that provides real-time scoreboards for the teams.
