# multi-vitamin-main-server
multivitamin is a challenge for highschool students to solve problems from different fields 

this project is aimed to be a platform for the challenge 

students can request a problem then the program will print the problem (problems are in pdf format and the program edit the pdf file to add the students group name and some other information).

after that students can give their question back and the program let them to get a new problem.

on the other hand some people check the answers and give the students their score.

the server has an API to get the realtime score board of the teams.
